# AoC-2022
My Advent of Code 2022

## Golang
I tried to solve the puzzles with Golang!

I am new to this languane, and hopefully I will get progressively better until the end.
If you have any tips, tricks or suggestions for me, please consider writing me on Discord (you can find my discord in my bio)

## Unfinished Approaches
All currently working approaches are in the master branch. 
Started and not finished (or not working xD) approaches are located at the other branches, each indetified by the name of the day. If they are fixed, they will be PRed to the master branch.

# Merry Christmas!
