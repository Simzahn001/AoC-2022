# AoC-2022
My Advent of Code 2022

I tried to solve the puzzles with Golang!

I am new to this languane, and hopefully I will get progressively better until the end.
If you have any tips, tricks or suggestions for me, please consider writing me on Discord (you can find my discord in my bio)

Merry Christmas!
